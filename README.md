# A VQGAN + CLIP project

## what is this?
### This uses the 2 neural networks, VQGAN and CLIP to generate an image or cover for a song you give it.

## How does it work?
First follow the instalation [instructions by nerdyrodent](https://github.com/nerdyrodent/VQGAN-CLIP) or follow their [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7ZP0__FXs), exept use the `generate.py` file listed in this repository.

Now just run your generate.py file and enter your song name and artist when propted.

You can also controll the number of maximum iterations with the -i argument when running `generate.py`. By default it is 500.
